# Porfolio Ecommerce Clothing App (WIP)
A work in progress for an example Ecommerce clothing app using React Native and Typescript.
The backend server is being written in Ruby On Rails in a separate repo. This repo requires the server to be run locally in order to receive data until I finish and host it.

# Development
## Prerequisites

Follow the [React Native getting started instructions](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) for your operating system (select the *React Native CLI Quickstart* option).

## Installation

Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Zheynas/portfolio_shop):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zheynas/portfolio_shop && cd portfolio_shop
```

Install all dependencies using Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
```

### IOS Emulation

Test your installation by starting the ios emulator:

```bash
react-native run-ios
```

You should see an ios device emulator running the App, after waiting 30 - 60 seconds.

Press `ctrl+cmd+z` to enable hot reloading, live reload and remote debugging.
